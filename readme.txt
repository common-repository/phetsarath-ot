== Description ==
Change Lao font to Phetsarath OT only a couple clicks.
Since Lao's standard font is Phetsarath OT but the Windows and Unix system are using another font instead and it must be difficult for End-user or non-developer to change the font to Phetsarath OT. That's the purpose of this plugin.
